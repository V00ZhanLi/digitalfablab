<p><mark><b><u>5 June 2020:</u></b></mark><br/> Today our class started on laser cutting, I have done laser cutting before as part of a module, where we learn the types of files to use for the cutter and the safety of using it and done a simple project of creating a phone holder. However, back then it was the technicians who helped us to use the software and command the laser cutter, now, we do it ourselves.</p>
        
<p>So for laser cutting, the first thing will be how it works, basically, you have a laser, pointing to the bottom controlled by some motors, that allows it to move in X-Y plane. The machine will then move the laser to the designated spot where the laser will be focused and vaporise the part away, and with that you can create lines and other patterns on it, and depending on how strong the laser is, it could penetrate through and cut a piece out, and thus that is how laser cutting works.</p>

<p>The process for laser cutting can change a couple of things such as the speed of the movement of the laser, the intensity of the laser, the number of pulses per second, all these are for being able to cut different types of material as different materials need different settings, or the type of job you want, cutting or engraving.</p>
        
<p>To start, laser cutters can read dxf files, fusion 360 has the ability to save files as dxf, once an item is done, you can save it's sketch as dxf and you can export the file to somewhere like inkscape to do some alignment work before sending it to the cutter software.</p>
