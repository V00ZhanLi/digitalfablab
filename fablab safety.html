<p>1. Students are not allowed to enter and work in any laboratory or workshop in the
    absence of the lecturer-in-charge or Technical Supporting Officer (TSO).</p>
    
     <p>2. Students must be properly attired according to the guidelines below :<br/>

to the project workshop/ laboratory for filing. You can request the blank risk assessment form
    from the Technical Support Officer or download the softcopy from Blackboard.</p>
    
    <p><strong><ins><mark>SPECIFIC SAFETY RULES & REGULATIONS IN FAB LAB AND MACHINE SHOP</mark></ins></strong></p>
    
<p>It is recommended that you familiarise yourself thoroughly with the operation of the machine and
adhere strictly to the following safety rules and regulations. If in doubt, please ask the Instructor or
Technical Support Officer (TSO). In this way, we can prevent accidents that may result in operator’s
injury, costly damage to the machine, or scrapped work-pieces.</p>
    
<p>1. A clean, neat, orderly machine and work area is the first step in safety. Keep all guards and covers
in place and all machine cabinet doors closed.</p>
    
<p>2. Do not operate machines or equipment until you have been properly instructed and authorized to
do so by your Instructor/TSO.</p>
    
<p>3. Do not start the machine or spindle until the work-piece and work-holding devices are securely
fastened.</p>
    
<p>4. During any activity that requires the handling of work-holding devices, tools, measuring devices, or
work-piece parts in the cutting zone, the machine’s motors must be in the stationary mode.</p>
    
<p>5. Know the position of the Emergency Stop push-button of the machine. Activate it during
emergency situation.</p>
    
    <p>6. Do not lean on any moving parts when the machine is in operation.</p>
    
<p>7. If you must remove hot tooling or sharp tools, switch off the machine and put on the hand gloves.</p>
    
<p>8. Never clear chips when the spindle is rotating. Never remove chips with your bare hands. Use a
brush or tool designed for that purpose.</p>
    
<p>9. When operating machine, it requires your undivided attention. No “horseplay” or “monkey about”
is allowed in your work area. If you need to attend to another matter, stop the machine until you
can give it the full attention required.</p>
    
<p>10. Be alert for loose, worn, or broken parts and abnormal sounds and noises. When you suspect a
problem, do not operate the machine. Report the problem at once to the Instructor or Technical
Supporting Officer (TSO) for corrective action.</p>
    
    <p>11. Do not use machine, if safety guard is not properly installed.</p>
    
    <p>12. Do not leave any materials lying on the floor. Unwanted materials should be put into the scrap
bins.</p>
    
    <p>13. When operating the machine tools, ensure that other workshop users are not exposed to danger.</p>
    
    <p>14. Always use a brush to sweep off all waste materials from the workbench.</p>
    
    <p>15. Do not forget to clean up your workplace and machine tools after each use.</p>
    
    <p><strong><ins><mark>FIRST AID</mark></ins></strong></p>
    
    <p>In the event of a laboratory or workshop accident, students must immediately inform the lecturer-incharge or TSO.</p>
    
    <p><strong><ins><mark>FIRE EMERGENCY EVACUATION</mark></ins></strong></p>
    
    <p>Students must know the location of fire extinguishers.<br/>
    
        Do not obstruct them with your personal belongings.</p>
    
    <p><strong><ins><mark>IN THE CASE OF ACCIDENT or FIRE :</mark></ins></strong></p>

    <p>1. Do not panic.<br/>
    
<p>2. Quickly and calmly inform the lecturer-in-charge or TSO or follow the SP’s
    Three-step Emergency Procedure:</p>
    
    <p>1. For ambulance or fire brigade, call 995<br/>
    2. Instruct them to enter Gate 1 (Main Entrance) along Dover Road<br/>
    3. Inform Campus Security by calling 6772-1234 for all emergencies and incident reporting.</p>
<p>3. Be familiar with the evacuation route and designated assembly area for the laboratory or workshop
you are working in. These are posted on exit doors or at convenient location(s) within the
    laboratory or workshop.</p>
