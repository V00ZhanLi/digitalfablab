<p><mark>18 May 2020:</mark><br/> In class we learnt how to design a cup, vase without the use of offsetting plane and lofting, and creating a hollow cube with a sphere inside.</p>
<p>We start off by sketching the basic shape of the cup/vase, and using the "revolve" function under "solid"-->"create", by revolving around the z-plane, you can create an entire new body, and after that, just shell it and its done.</p>

        <img src="images/vase1.png"  width="420"/>
        <img src="images/vase2.png"  width="420"/>
<p>Next one is a hollow cube with a sphere in it, just like previously, we create a hollow cube and drilled out holes on the sides of the cube.</p>
        <img src="images/ballcube.png"  width="420"/>
<p>Then lastly, we draw a sphere with just a bit smaller diameter and move it into the inside of the cube, then just a bit of filleting on the corners and it is done!</p>

<p><mark>15 May 2020:</mark><br/> Today our class learned about some functions to use in fusion 360, we learnt how to use functions to design things like a egg cup, a star and we design our own personalised keychain, the egg cup was the most interesting to me because I never used offset plane and loft before to create a shape like this, this could allow me to design something like a bottle or vase with ease.</p>
<p>By using the offset plane under the "costruct" function, you can shift the plane up and draw shapes on top of your other sketches and by using loft, you can combine all the sketches into a solid body.</p>

        <img src="images/bottom1.png"  width="420"/>
        <img src="images/bottom2.png"  width="420"/>
        <img src="images/bottom3.png"  width="420"/>

        <img src="images/bottom5.png"  width="420"/>
        <img src="images/bottom6.png"  width="420"/>
        <img src="images/loft.png"  width="420"/>
<p>And finally, using the "shell" function under the same place as "loft" you can hollow out the top to the size of an egg and that would give it a  cavity to store the egg in.</p>
        <img src="images/shell.png"  width="420"/>
<p>Using the "shell" function, you can hollow out the inside of an object so you can use it for anything that you wish to use it for.<br/>I used the shell function to hollow out this cube and I use "split body" function under "modify" to split this cube and to show the inside.</p>

<p><mark>8 May 2020:</mark><br/> Today our class started on 3d printing design, although I have done 3d printing back in year 1, I never really did explore deeper into more of the app's functions and never really did more complex designs before, so I am looking forward to the following weeks learning about 3d printing.</p>
<p>Our first project is this keychain, which we made with the steps from our teacher.</p>
        <img src="images/keychain.png"  width="520"/>
    <p>First step: Go to "create" then "create sketch", select the bottom plane.</p>
        <img src="images/plane.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Second step: On "Sketch", go to "Create" and select "2 point rectangle", press on the pivot and you can stretch it out and type in any value for the size of rectangle you want.</p>
        <img src="images/second.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Third step: On the left of the rectangle, draw a circle using the "centre diameter circle" in "create" and state the diameter you want for the ring.</p>
        <img src="images/third.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Fourth step: Draw a smaller circle in the bigger circle to indicate the hole for the chain to go in.</p>
        <img src="images/fourth.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Fifth step: Under "modify", search for the "fillet" option and using that function, by selecting 2 sides, you can curve the sharp corners and you can adjust how much you want to curve, do it for all 4 corners and you now have the basic sketch of the keychain.</p>
        <img src="images/fifth.png" width="520"/>
        <img src="images/first.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Sixth step: In "solid", click for the "extrude" function and select onto the body and the outer part of the circle to extrude it, this will allow it to have a solid body.</p>
        <img src="images/sixth.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Seventh step: Create a new sketch again on the top plane and use the "text" function under "create" and you can type in your name, you can then adjust it's size and bold and italicise your name.</p>
        <img src="images/seventh.png" width="520"/>
    <p>Eighth step: Select your name and you can extrude it, but instead of creating a new body, you are going to cut out your name, do not go too far down or it will cut through the body.</p>
        <img src="images/eighth.png" height="300"/>
    <p>Once all the steps are done, just check for any mistakes and its done!</p>
