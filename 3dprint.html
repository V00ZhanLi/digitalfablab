    <h2>here you can see my progress of learning over the weeks</h2>
<p>15 May 2020:<br/> tuday our class learned about some functions to use in fusion 360, we learnt how to use functions to design things like a egg cup, a star and we design our own personalised keychain, the egg cup was the most interesting to me because I never used offset plane and loft before to create a shape like this, this could allow me to design something like a bottle or vase with ease.</p>
<p>8 May 2020:<br/> Today our class started on 3d printing design, although I have done 3d printing back in year 1, I never really did explore deeper into more of the app's functions and never really did more complex designs before, so I am looking forward to the following weeks learning about 3d printing.</p>
